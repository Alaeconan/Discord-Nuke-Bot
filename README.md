`Warning`
**Do not involve us if you get banned.**

*This is a free to customize discord nuke bot!*
*It is fine if you customize this nuker*
*Aslong as you give us credits.*

# Customizing
**Many people will struggle with this.**

*All you need to do is, near the top of the code
it shows this*

token = "TOKEN"                                            #
spam_messages = "Spam message"         #
massdm = "Currently broken.."                    #
rolenames = "Role Names To Spam"         #                            
channels = "Channels To Spam Names"  #

for the **Token** All you do it paste your bot token,
but you have to enable server member intents.

for the **spam_messages** Make a message up
EG; *spam_messages = "@everyone nuked"*
But make sure not to remove the quotation marks!

***Massdm broken***

For the **rolenames** Just type your spam roles name.
eg; rolenames = "nuked by strosity"

For the **Channels** Just think of a random channel name spam.
EG; channels = "Strosity Nuked"


# Have fun!
Dont skid this!
